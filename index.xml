      <description>I myself first heard about the concept of exploration vs exploitation in a rationality camp. There, one morning, without any context we were presented with a simple card game, where
 a full deck is non-randomly divided into 4 piles of 13 cards each. Each of the decks is then separately shuffled. Each red card has a value attached to it. Each turn we get to pick a card from whichever pile we desire.</description>

      <description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Jēkabs - a high-school student from Riga State Gymnasium No. 1, Latvia. Academically, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in mathematics, computer science and economics. I particularly enjoy working on projects that require me to combine models and intuitions from at least two of these and many other fields (of which I know too little of to concretely list them). I&amp;rsquo;ve also always liked tinkering with tech, whether that&amp;rsquo;s Lego robots in 2016 , or home automation and computer networks now.</description>
